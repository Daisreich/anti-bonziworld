# Anti-Grabify Browser Extension
The official GitHub repository for the Anti-Grabify (formerly known as Anti-Protonian) add-on / extension. If you don't know what Anti-Grabify is, it is a chrome extension and firefox add-on which is meant for blocking IP grabbers from the Grabify service. This extension will block all the IP grabber links that Grabify currently uses. You can get the extension from here. If you want to add it in Chrome, Opera, or any other Chromium based browser, the first thing you will have to do is enable developer mode. After that click "Load Unpacked Extension" then choose the "chrome" folder. As for Firefox, you can get it from the Firefox Add-on website here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/anti-grabify/
